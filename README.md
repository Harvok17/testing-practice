# Testing Practice

This is a Test Driven Development(TDD) practice using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

## Excercises

1. Capitalize(string) takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.
2. ReverseString(string) takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A calculator object that contains the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
4. Caesar Cipher.
5. Array Analysis. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.

   ```javascript
   const object = analyze([1, 8, 3, 4, 2, 6]);
   object ==
     {
       average: 4,
       min: 1,
       max: 8,
       length: 6,
     };
   ```
